Debian/Twitter interface
========================

Debian Developers can tweet to the @debianproject Twitter account by
simply sending a GPG-clear signed POST request.

Example:

 echo "Debian is the shiznit" | gpg --clearsign | lwp-request -mPOST http://twitter.debian.net/post

It's a nice simple hack by David Moreno <david@axiombox.com>.
